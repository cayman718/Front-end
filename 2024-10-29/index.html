        <pre>
            Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
            I miss your touch on nights when I'm hollow
            I know you crossed a bridge that I can't follow
            Since the love that you left is all that I get
            I want you to know
            That if I can't be close to you
            I'll settle for the ghost of you
            I miss you more than life (more than life)
            And if you can't be next to me
            Your memory is ecstasy
            I miss you more than life
            I miss you more than life
            Youngblood thinks there's always tomorrow
            I need more time but time can't be borrowed
            I'd leave it all behind if I could follow
            Since the love that you left is all that I get
            I want you to know
            That if I can't be close to you
            I'll settle for the ghost of you
            I miss you more than life (yeah)
            And if you can't be next to me
            Your memory is ecstasy (oh)
            I miss you more than life
            I miss you more than life
            Whoa
            Na, na-na
            More than life
            (Oh)
            So if I can't get close to you
            I'll settle for the ghost of you
            But I miss you more than life
            And if you can't be next to me
            Your memory is ecstasy
            I miss you more than life
            I miss you more than life
